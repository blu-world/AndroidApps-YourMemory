The goal of the game is to match all of the paired tiles in as few moves and little time as possible. You can also use your photos/images as a background so when you solve the puzzle
you will see the picture. Or you can just use the build-in images. <br />
There are two types of matching games. 1) Alphabet match and 2) color match. <br />
The Alphabet Match is just like any other matching game, you matching the letter under each tile to finish the game, but
the Color Match has a twist to it. Each tile still has an letter but with different color. there are two tiles with the same color
(but different letter) the goal is to match the color instead of the letter. For example, a Red "<font color='red'>A</font>" will matching to Red "<font color='red'>B</font>" 
but not the Yellow "<font color='yellow'>A</font>", and so on.<br />
This game does NOT have advertisements and do not need any permissions on your phone.
<br />
Enjoy.
